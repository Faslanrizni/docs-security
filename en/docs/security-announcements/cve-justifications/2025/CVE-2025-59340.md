### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A deserialization vulnerability in Jinjava (prior to 2.8.1) that allowed attacker-controlled input — via `mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical()` — to force Jackson's `ObjectMapper` to deserialize into arbitrary classes, enabling sandbox escape (e.g., instantiating `java.net.URL` to read local files) and potentially leading to remote code execution; fixed in 2.8.1. [^1]

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 4.2.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

Jinjava is utilized solely for templating configurations file of WSO2 products. The vulnerability would only be exploitable if a malicious actor could gain write access to the filesystem hosting WSO2 product or relevant configuration directories. Under normal circumstances, and when deployments are hardened in accordance with WSO2’s Secure Production Deployment Guidelines [^2], this vulnerability is not practically exploitable.

In WSO2 APIM, Jinjava is used to template configurations in config files. The reported vulnerability involves processing externally-influenced input, via the template configurations. Therefore, unless an attacker has write access to the server’s filesystem or configuration directories, the vulnerability is not exploitable in practice. Assuming proper server hardening and file system access controls, this issue poses no practical risk.
