### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A deserialization vulnerability in Jinjava (prior to 2.8.1) that allowed attacker-controlled input — via `mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical()` — to force Jackson's `ObjectMapper` to deserialize into arbitrary classes, enabling sandbox escape (e.g., instantiating `java.net.URL` to read local files) and potentially leading to remote code execution; fixed in 2.8.1. [^1]

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 API Manager : 4.2.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

Upon evaluating the impact of upgrading Jinjava 2.6.0 to 2.8.1, we identified significant architectural changes that introduce compatibility issues. Jinjava 2.8.1 does not support Java 11 runtime, whereas WSO2 API Manager has support for Java 11 onwards. Due to this concern, we are publishing this CVE justification with a detailed analysis of the CVE, outlining how associated risks are mitigated in WSO2 products.

In WSO2 APIM, Jinjava is used to template configurations in config files. The reported vulnerability involves processing externally-influenced input, via the template configurations. Therefore, unless an attacker has write access to the server’s filesystem or configuration directories, the vulnerability is not exploitable in practice. Assuming proper server hardening and file system access controls, this issue poses no practical risk.
