### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
The vulnerability mentioned in CVE-2021-42646 has been addressed and fixed in the respective versions as per the advisory published at WSO2-2021-1289 [^2]. The affected components and their corresponding fixed versions are listed below:

### Affected Components and Fixed Versions:

#### WSO2 Carbon Identity Application Management (`org.wso2.carbon.identity.application.mgt`)

Unaffected ranges are,

| version (start range) | <= version (range) | Version Type |
|:---------------------:|:------------------:|:------------:|
| 5.12.153.10           | 5.12.153.*         | Commercial   |
| 5.12.387.4            | 5.12.387.*         | Commercial   |
| 5.14.97.8             | 5.14.97.*          | Commercial   |
| 5.17.5.59             | 5.17.5.*           | Commercial   |
| 5.18.187.53           | 5.18.187.*         | Commercial   |

### CONCLUSION

Based on the following key points:

- The incorrect listing of `org.wso2.carbon.identity.framework:org.wso2.carbon.identity.application.mgt_5.17.118` as a vulnerable component version.
- The impacted feature (file-based service provider creation through the Management Console) is not commonly used.
- A fix has already been included as per WSO2-2021-1289 [^2].

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is a false positive**, and **not an exploitable vulnerability** in WSO2 products when using the fixed or later versions.
