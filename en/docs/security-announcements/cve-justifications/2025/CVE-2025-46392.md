### REPORTED VULNERABILITY

A Denial of Service attack through uncontrolled resource consumption by providing a crafted config file with malicious or recursive variable interpolation. [^1]

### REPORTED PRODUCTS

- WSO2 Identity Server : 7.0.0, 7.1.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

The reported vulnerability involves uncontrolled resource consumption via malicious or recursive variable interpolation in configuration files. In WSO2 Identity Server, the affected component is used exclusively to load the log4j2.properties file. This file is not user-controllable under normal deployment scenarios.

Therefore, unless an attacker has write access to the serverâ€™s filesystem or configuration directories, the vulnerability is not exploitable in practice. Assuming proper server hardening and file system access controls, this issue poses no practical risk.
